					<P CLASS = "music"> Music, as we know it, is no more. No one makes music any more like <STRONG> Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Bob Dylan, ZZ Top, Queen </STRONG> and many more used to. Their music & lyrics had a deep meaning which could take you to a different world. Their music could touch your soul. Music back then used to connect everyone. Now with artists like <STRONG> One Direction, Justin Bieber, 5 Seconds Of Summer </STRONG> etc. it’s all about who becomes the best, who becomes more popular, who has more fans and what not. Most people don’t even understand their music but still cheer them to show off or whatever. Sad but true. </P>
					<P STYLE="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; word-spacing: 2px; letter-spacing: 1.5px; font-size: 25px;"> Well hang on, that's where we come in! </P>
